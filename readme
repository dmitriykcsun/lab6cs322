This is a submission for lab 6 for CS322, Spring 2020, Prof Benson.

The program spiritd creates a daemon process, which you can see the PID of using 'ps -ef' after running it. Afterwards using 'kill -USR1 PID' or 'kill -USR2 PID' will send a signal to the daemon to run the mole process which logs a string to a file in your home directory. Runs as described in the lap guidelines on my linux laptop.
